The world_of_programming is amazing!

A programmer wrote an a, then tried abb and even abbb, just to test his code. He wanted to make_sure_that_every_variable_name_was_written_correctly. Suddenly, he noticed that SomeVariablesWereWrittenLikeThis, and others_like_this.

He also found Amazingly, Beautiful, and SuperFun functions in his code. One of them, called convert_this_string, turned hello_world into HelloWorld. Another function could take SuperCoolFeature and split it into Super Cool Feature.

But then, he saw a messy sentence:
"Hello,world. This is a test, and it should be formatted!"

So, he quickly replaced spaces, commas, and dots with colons:
Hello:world:This:is:a:test:and:it:should:be:formatted!

Finally, he checked if a...anything...b matched his rules. And it did! a_b, a123b, aXYZb â€” everything worked perfectly.

Now, his code was clean, and he could finally go to sleep! ðŸ˜´
